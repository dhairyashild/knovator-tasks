# Distributed Laravel Application Setup

## Overview

This project hosts a distributed setup for a Laravel application, designed with security, scalability, and cost-effectiveness in mind. The application architecture separates key components for improved performance and maintainability:

- **Web Server:** Handles HTTP requests.
- **PHP-FPM:** Executes PHP code efficiently.
- **Redis:** Provides caching and session management.
- **MySQL:** Serves as the relational database.
- **ElasticSearch:** Supports advanced search capabilities.

---

## Architecture Highlights

- **Web Server & PHP-FPM:** Separate layers for handling requests and PHP processing, enabling horizontal scaling.
- **Redis:** Caching and session management for improved performance and reduced database load.
- **MySQL:** Primary database with read replicas for load balancing and backups for data safety.
- **ElasticSearch:** Distributed search engine enhancing search capabilities and performance.

## Security

- SSL termination is implemented over the load balancer.
- Load balancer rules enforce secure, encrypted connections.
- Application is accessible via the domain `desai-devops.info` using HTTPS.

---

## Scalability Strategies

- Load balancers distribute incoming traffic efficiently across web and PHP-FPM servers.
- Autoscaling is configured to dynamically adjust the number of instances based on traffic patterns.
- Read replicas for MySQL RDS enhance read performance and provide failover.
- Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform) is used to automate and scale resource provisioning.

---

## Cost Optimization

- Managed cloud services are utilized to minimize maintenance overhead.
- Autoscaling and on-demand instances prevent resource overprovisioning.
- Redis caching reduces the load on the MySQL database, lowering compute and storage costs.
- Efficient resource allocation ensures cost-effective operation without sacrificing performance.

This architecture provides a **secure, scalable, and cost-effective** foundation for running modern Laravel applications in a distributed environment.
